The gist is that you inject arbitrary JS on the page layout by taking some JS code like the commented out section in AccountOverlayPanel.page and then base 64 encode it. Note the base64 is needed so that JS runs on page load. If this were to be a lightbox that appears on a click, 

You take the base-64 code and add it to the page layout. It sets up the listener so that AccountOverlayPanel can communicate to page layout. This line of communication is needed so that when the icon is clicked in the visualforce page, it communicates to the page layout to open the lightbox. If you didn't do this, the lightbox would just appear in the frame of the visualforce sections and be extremely limited.
